The game's main objective will be to achieve the maximum level of 100. Were the 
project's scope to be expanded we may also include:

    * Multiple factions/professions. Each profession will allow different 
      games/items that other professions will need.
* Levels
* Working as a minigame
* Fatigue mechanic

## The game may have
